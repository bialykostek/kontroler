   abstract = {Complex 3D obstacle environments raise high requirements of the rapid reaction capability and safety aiming at the maneuver control for obstacle avoidance (MCOA) of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (FUAVs). Considering the above demands, a learning-based reactive MCOA framework is proposed in this paper. First, the fundamental controller in this framework composed of the interfered fluid dynamical system (IFDS) guidance law and back-stepping control loops is established. Then, aiming at the rapid reaction requirement, a deep-reinforcement-learning-based (DRL-based) reactive online decision-making mechanism for obstacle avoidance matched with the IFDS guidance law is proposed. And aiming at the high safety requirement, the closed-loop system composed of the above fundamental controller and the FUAV 6-DOF nonlinear dynamic model is introduced into the DRL training environments so that the FUAV state transitions considering the characteristics of controllers and dynamics can be realized, and the corresponding reward functions can be calculated accordingly. On this basis, the optimal guidance instructions with high trackability can be resolved in real time using the actor networks trained by the proposed DRL-based mechanism, and the safe maneuver control in complex obstacle environments can be achieved. Finally, a normative modeling method of DRL training environments matched with the reactive MCOA framework is proposed to promote training efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by simulations.},

At the same time, aiming at the problem that the coefficient setting of parameters in S-plane control completely depends on experience and cannot be adjusted adaptively, the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is introduced, and a neural network S-plane control model which can realize on-line adaptive adjustment of the coefficient of parameters in S-plane control is proposed. The simulation results based on the data of a certain UAV show that compared with the S-plane control, the proposed neural network S-plane control model has the characteristics of fast response speed, strong anti-interference ability, and strong robustness. In addition, it also has the function of adaptive adjustment, which shows good control performance.},

   abstract = {Applications of deep reinforcement learning (RL) based control have mainly focused on multi-rotor unmanned aerial systems (UASs). The limited number of research on AI-based flight controllers for fixed-wing UASs platforms lacks rigorous validation and verification (V&V) flight tests. Simulation V&V are conducted for AI-based controllers and only AI-based guidance has been implemented for the flight test verification. The complexity and scarcity of research on AI-based flight controllers for fixed-wing UASs are multilayers, however high speed and inertia of this class of aircraft, structural load limitations, stall speed and angle of attack, and large impact of aerodynamic forces and moments are among the main reasons. Tight tracking requirements and nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamics in presence of external disturbances only exacerbate the complexity. The traditional controller design methods (e.g., Modern and Classical Control) heavily rely on the quality of aircraft physics-based dynamic models. Robust controllers address the uncertainties in the dynamic model by trading off the performance of flight controllers. This work presents the development of a policy-based flight controller (longitudinal-directional) for a fixed-wing UAS using a model-free deep RL algorithm called PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization). The UAS has a 2.66 m wingspan, weighs 6.4 Kg, and cruises at 15.3 m/s. The controller is trained in simulation using a low-fidelity dynamic model with appropriate dynamic randomization to tackle the issue of parametric uncertainties. To further improve the transferability of the controller, we also incorporate memory functions into the policy using RNN (recurrent neural network) architecture. We opt for the PPO Deep RL algorithm for its monotonic and stable policy improvement characteristics and less sensitivity to hyper-parameters. The developed controller performance is first validated in HiTL (hardware-in-the-loop) simulations. Several actual flight tests are conducted for the verification of the developed controller. The AI-based controller is flight tested in different weather conditions to quantify its robustness toward external disturbances. Both simulation and flight test results are presented in this work.},

   abstract = {Path following is a basic autonomous navigation capability for UAV's and in this paper we present a nonlinear 3D path following kinematic controller. In order to solve this problem, we use the typical multi-loop control structure in which the navigation controller directs the aircraft to the desired path, while the inner loop acts as an autopilot which stabilizes the nonlinear dynamics and tracks the command generated by the outer loop. Under the assumption that the autopilot is well tuned and the airspeed, fight-path angle, and bank angle states converge to the desired response to their commanded values, we use a kinematic model as a suitable control model for the fixed wing UAV. With the introduction of a virtual target, the proposed Lyapunov based kinematic controller for outer loop can steer the UAV asymptotically to approach the desired path. The proposed controller is validated in a 6-DoF simulation environment platform named MAV3DSim.},

   abstract = {The fixed full-wing layout unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has simple structure and high aerodynamic efficiency, but the special configuration and manipulation characteristics bring challenges to the controller design, which has little related research work. Aiming at the aileronless and rudderless manipulation mode, considering the disturbance and uncertainty, this paper proposes a comprehensive stability controller for the fixed full-wing layout UAV under manipulation constraints. First, adaptive neural network dynamic surface control schemes based on the asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function and auxiliary system are designed for pitch and yaw attitude control. Then, this paper combines the adaptive super-twisting observer, terminal sliding mode control, and double power reaching law to design the airspeed controller and the altitude controller, and further introduces the pitch angle command constraint in the altitude controller. In addition, an improved vector field-based lateral-directional path following control method is designed to realize straight-line and circular orbit path following control. In this paper, the approximation and compensation effects of the radial basis function neural network and robust compensator are fully verified. The design of the pitch angle command constraint specifically considers the characteristics of weak pitch manipulation ability, small available trim airspeed range, and low longitudinal moment of inertia. The developed path following control approach effectively prevents the nonlinear tracking differentiator from generating unreasonable yaw angle commands. Simulation results also show that the proposed controller can enable the fixed full-wing layout UAV to achieve the typical three-dimensional mission flight with high robustness and high precision, and make the fixed full-wing layout UAV remain stable even after suffering stall and manipulation saturation under the action of the gust wind field.},

   abstract = {Landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a difficult problem because of their light weight, external disturbances, and strong coupling between the longitudinal and lateral modes. This paper presents the design of a new automatic landing system for fixed wing UAVs subject to wind gusts and errors of the measurement sensors. Using the airplane nonlinear model, a new control approach is proposed. It unifies the backstepping and the dynamic inversion methods to directly control the roll and the yaw angles of the UAV, the flight altitude and the speed (longitudinal plane) by ensuring a constant forward velocity during all the three landing stages. The wind gusts and the three components of the UAV velocity are estimated with a disturbance observer, as part of the auto-landing system. The novel control architecture is software implemented and validated by complex numerical simulations. The obtained characteristics prove the finite time stability and robustness of the new automatic landing system even in the case of landing affected by wind gusts and errors of the sensors.},

   abstract = {To realize the three-dimensional stabilization control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we analyze the nonholonomic characteristics, constraint non-integrability, and controllability of UAVs. To simplify the trigonometric function term in the dynamics of the UAV and avoid the singularity problem of the Euler angle in describing attitude, we use the quaternion theory to transform the dynamics of the UAV to avoid the complex trigonometric function derivation, which makes the dynamic matrix more concise. Based on this, a continuous periodic time-varying controller (CPTVC) is designed, and the effectiveness of the controller is proved using the homogeneous method. Finally, the results of the hardware in a loop simulation indicated that the exponential stability provided by the feedback controller can realize the three-dimensional stabilization of any initial position.},
