   abstract = {Path following is a basic autonomous navigation capability for UAV's and in this paper we present a nonlinear 3D path following kinematic controller. In order to solve this problem, we use the typical multi-loop control structure in which the navigation controller directs the aircraft to the desired path, while the inner loop acts as an autopilot which stabilizes the nonlinear dynamics and tracks the command generated by the outer loop. Under the assumption that the autopilot is well tuned and the airspeed, fight-path angle, and bank angle states converge to the desired response to their commanded values, we use a kinematic model as a suitable control model for the fixed wing UAV. With the introduction of a virtual target, the proposed Lyapunov based kinematic controller for outer loop can steer the UAV asymptotically to approach the desired path. The proposed controller is validated in a 6-DoF simulation environment platform named MAV3DSim.},

   abstract = {The fixed full-wing layout unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has simple structure and high aerodynamic efficiency, but the special configuration and manipulation characteristics bring challenges to the controller design, which has little related research work. Aiming at the aileronless and rudderless manipulation mode, considering the disturbance and uncertainty, this paper proposes a comprehensive stability controller for the fixed full-wing layout UAV under manipulation constraints. First, adaptive neural network dynamic surface control schemes based on the asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function and auxiliary system are designed for pitch and yaw attitude control. Then, this paper combines the adaptive super-twisting observer, terminal sliding mode control, and double power reaching law to design the airspeed controller and the altitude controller, and further introduces the pitch angle command constraint in the altitude controller. In addition, an improved vector field-based lateral-directional path following control method is designed to realize straight-line and circular orbit path following control. In this paper, the approximation and compensation effects of the radial basis function neural network and robust compensator are fully verified. The design of the pitch angle command constraint specifically considers the characteristics of weak pitch manipulation ability, small available trim airspeed range, and low longitudinal moment of inertia. The developed path following control approach effectively prevents the nonlinear tracking differentiator from generating unreasonable yaw angle commands. Simulation results also show that the proposed controller can enable the fixed full-wing layout UAV to achieve the typical three-dimensional mission flight with high robustness and high precision, and make the fixed full-wing layout UAV remain stable even after suffering stall and manipulation saturation under the action of the gust wind field.},

   abstract = {Landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a difficult problem because of their light weight, external disturbances, and strong coupling between the longitudinal and lateral modes. This paper presents the design of a new automatic landing system for fixed wing UAVs subject to wind gusts and errors of the measurement sensors. Using the airplane nonlinear model, a new control approach is proposed. It unifies the backstepping and the dynamic inversion methods to directly control the roll and the yaw angles of the UAV, the flight altitude and the speed (longitudinal plane) by ensuring a constant forward velocity during all the three landing stages. The wind gusts and the three components of the UAV velocity are estimated with a disturbance observer, as part of the auto-landing system. The novel control architecture is software implemented and validated by complex numerical simulations. The obtained characteristics prove the finite time stability and robustness of the new automatic landing system even in the case of landing affected by wind gusts and errors of the sensors.},

   abstract = {To realize the three-dimensional stabilization control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we analyze the nonholonomic characteristics, constraint non-integrability, and controllability of UAVs. To simplify the trigonometric function term in the dynamics of the UAV and avoid the singularity problem of the Euler angle in describing attitude, we use the quaternion theory to transform the dynamics of the UAV to avoid the complex trigonometric function derivation, which makes the dynamic matrix more concise. Based on this, a continuous periodic time-varying controller (CPTVC) is designed, and the effectiveness of the controller is proved using the homogeneous method. Finally, the results of the hardware in a loop simulation indicated that the exponential stability provided by the feedback controller can realize the three-dimensional stabilization of any initial position.},

   abstract = {A prospective issue that the finite-time reliable trajectory tracking control (TTC) scheme for a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with error constraint is considered in this paper. The outer-loop position dynamics is formulated as a quadratic integral system. By utilizing a finite-time command filter to deal with the computational explosion in backstepping control architecture, a finite-time super-twisting sliding-mode disturbance observer (SMDO) is proposed to estimate the uncertain external disturbances. In addition, a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is used to constrain the trajectory tracking error and verify the finite-time stability of the reliable TTC scheme. Eventually, the effectiveness is given by simulation results.},
